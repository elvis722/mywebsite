					This type of the Door looks really simple, mostly people choose it when they like having all things simply designed. 
					They don’t want to overload they place with different designs. Here the tubes are all in form of a rectangle which are 4x4 and 2.2 thick. 
					We also can se that the outside and inside part are connected with a wire, also known as wire door. 
					And also here the owner decided to make it with a motor, which he can open or close it with a touch of a button. 
					As for every model the color can be picked by the user.
