					One of the most recent machines that we bought is Lathe Electronics. This is one of the most amazing machines you can make, 
					remake change and a lot of other things with this machine. With this machine you cannot work only metal works but also: plastic and wood. 
					It works by rotating what we want to work on, around the cutting knives which do the work. With this machine we create one of the most strong 
					hinge for the big doors that we do. There are a lot of things that you might need, and we can do it with this machine. Lets say one of the 
					simplest is the sic of your car wheel doesn’t work good we can repair it. And one of the most amazing things that we did with this machine is 
					we created another machine. A machine that curves different types of Tubes and pipes. All the part which were needed for this new machine were 
					done with the Lathe.

					If you’re interested in windows doors and fences, we work with two types of metals: Steen and Aluminum.
					We have different designs for each type, we never stop trying to find something new something the user would like.
					However, if you don’t see any design (doors, window, fences) that you like here, instead you have an idea of how would you like it to be.
					You can come to us and by talking to us and explaining what u want, we can design and create your idea.Besides all of this you also have to
					know that our work always has a high quality. We choose the best material which we know that never failed us.
					The work is strong and sustainable, and any defect that happens in the meantime we are one call away.

					After we saw that our work was from a high quality and people were demanding a high-quality doors and windows we decided to expend our work.
					18 years ago, we also decided to build doors and windows for homes from PVC. At first we have worked with material that was made in Turkey,
					sit wasn’t good nor bad, but this was the best that we could find in Kosovo. We had problems from time to time with it.
					Then couple of years later one of the best PVC materials arrived in Kosovo named Kommerling. The company of this material
					gives 100 years of variety if the plastic curves or changes colors. Also for any defect that are not done by human we will 
					come and repair it. For more information about the PVC work you can search in the PVC section.
