Joe Smith Consulting

Helping Small Businesses Thrive

I help businesses of all sizes focus their branding and marketing efforts and build a thriving
business. I can show you how to avoid the "me too" approach that far too many businesses take, and I can help you
leverage technology to learn what your customers want from you most.

I'm happy to schedule a free 30-minute consulting session with you.You tell me what challenges you're facing and I'll 
give you some ideas about how we solve them.

Don't take my word for it, though - here's what my clients have to say.

"When I met with Joe for the first time, he asked great deep-dive questions about my business, seeking
to not only understand our needs, but help me understand my company's situation as well. While other marketing firms 
would have given up, Joe didn't - and the results speak for themselves."
Bill Dance
CEO, Dance Financial Services

Joe went above and beyond the agreed upon scope of work to make sure that we had what we need when we needed it. 
He advised on everything from the redesign of our website to social media and developing a plan to the 
design of our annual report. I will never be able to thank him enough
Grace Livingston
President, HealthCore Solutions

"Joe delivers that rare combination of deep expertise, hands-on pragmatism and real-world results
that is rare to find these days in any service provider, large or small. Our daily interactions with him have been
spectacular, and the outcomes have consistently exceeded our expectations."
Jim Garrett
VP, Hallmark Commercial
